    s.student_id,
    s.gpa,
    COUNT(e.course_id) as courses_enrolled,
    AVG(g.grade_percentage) as avg_grade_percentage
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN grades g ON s.id = g.student_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.first_name, s.last_name, s.student_id, s.gpa
ORDER BY s.gpa DESC;
```
