- "How many students are enrolled in each course?"

### SQL Examples
```sql
-- Top performing students
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as student_name, gpa
FROM students ORDER BY gpa DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Course attendance rates
SELECT c.course_name, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN a.status = 'present' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(a.id) as attendance_rate
FROM courses c LEFT JOIN attendance a ON c.id = a.course_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.course_name;

-- Grade distribution
SELECT letter_grade, COUNT(*) as count
FROM grades GROUP BY letter_grade ORDER BY count DESC;
```
